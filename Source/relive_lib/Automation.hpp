// Runs a script of commands (-automation=<file>), so a tool or a test can drive the game and see
// what it's doing without anyone watching it. With SDL_VIDEO_DRIVER=offscreen it needs no display.
//
// One command a line, its arguments separated by spaces. # starts a comment.
//
//   start <level> <path> <camera> [<x> <y>]
//       Start a new game at a camera, like the menus' level select: no movies, Abe made and put at
//       world position (x, y), or near the middle of the camera. Levels are named as in the path
//       JSON files, e.g. rupture_farms (see data_conversion/EnumSerialization.hpp).
//   wait_frames <n>
//       Let n frames run. A modal's frames (the pause menu, a movie) count too.
//   wait_until in_game
//       Until there's a controlled character on a loaded camera outside the menus.
//   wait_until camera <level> <path> <camera>
//       Until that camera is loaded.
//   hold <buttons> <frames>
//       Hold these buttons down on pad 1 for that many frames, then release them. Buttons are
//       joined with +, e.g. hold left+run 20. Names: up, down, left, right, run, action, sneak,
//       throw, hop, roll (AO) or fart (AE), speak1-speak8 (AE's 1-8 or AO's 4), chant,
//       pause, confirm (the menus' OK), back, cheat.
//   switch <id> <0|1>
//       Set a switch state, as a lever would.
//   electrocute [extra]
//       Electrocute the controlled character, as an electric wall does (it dies at the end). extra
//       adds the third, black sweep: the character is erased (AE: the greeter's and wall's).
//   invisible <out|in|now>
//       AE only. Abe's invisibility power: fade out, fade back in, or invisible straight away.
//   expect_objects <type> <count>
//       Fail unless exactly that many live objects have that type name (as dump_objects shows it,
//       e.g. eSlamDoor).
//   screenshot <file.png>
//       The next frame's 640x240 framebuffer, before it's scaled to the window.
//   dump_state <file.json>
//       The game, level/path/camera, frame numbers, whether a movie or other modal is running.
//   dump_objects <file.json>
//       Every game object, with its position and animation (blend mode, tint, layer...).
//   fmv <name>
//       Play a movie (e.g. BA1114), the way the game's camera changes do. It takes over the main loop
//       until it ends or is skipped: wait_frames counts its frames, and quit quits through it.
//   music <type> [<owner> [<flag4> [<flag20>]]]
//       Ask the game's MusicController for a music type (name or number, see SoundDebug.hpp) as
//       abe (default), other (a second dummy object) or none, with the controller's two flags.
//   kill_other
//       Destroy the dummy owner, so the controller's owner is dead.
//   sfx <index> [<volume> [<right volume>]]
//       Play a relive::SoundEffects entry (its index in Sfx.hpp), at its default volume if none;
//       with a right volume, in stereo.
//   sfx_pitch <index> <volume> <pitch>
//       Play a sound effect with a pitch offset in 1/128 semitones (SFX_Play_Pitch).
//   seq_play <index> [<volume> [<repeat>]]
//       Play a SEQ by its index in the game's SEQ table (volume default 100, repeat 0 = forever,
//       default 1). seq_stop <index> stops it.
//   timeout <seconds>
//       Fail if the script is still running after this long, counted from the start (default 120).
//   quit
//       Quit, which is also done when the script runs out.
//
// File paths are relative to the working directory (the game data). A command that fails logs an
// error and quits, and relive then returns 1.
